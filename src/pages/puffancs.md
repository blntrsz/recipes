# Hozzávalók:

- 113 grams (1 stick) butter
- 400 g sugar
- 3 eggs
- 6 g vanilla
- 113 g unsweetened chocolate
- 275 g flour
- 8 g baking powder
- 3 g salt
- 56 g confectioners sugar (for coating)

# Elkészítés:

1. In a large bowl, beat butter and sugar with a whisk until fluffy. Add the eggs and vanilla and whisk thoroughly, 2-3 minutes.
2. Melt the chocolate in the microwave or on the stove, be careful not to burn. Pour melted chocolate into the bowl and mix well with a spatula.
3. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt and add to the bowl. Mix well with a spatula until the dough is cohesive. Place a cover on the dough and refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour. The dough can keep in the fridge for several days.
    - Note: In my tests, I found the ideal temperature of the dough for rolling is 50 to 55 F. If it is too cold, leave it on the counter for a bit before rolling.
4. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Using a scoop, portion the dough into 20-gram pieces. Roll the dough into 1 inch balls and toss in the sifted confectioner's sugar. Place on a parchment-lined cookie sheet and bake for 10 minutes. The tops of cookies will crack or crinkle. After 10 minutes, check the temperature, it should be between 175 F and 185 F. They will be soft and gooey, let cool completely on the baking sheet so they firm up.
5. Store in an airtight container. These keep really well and are kind of better the next day. For a bonus treat, try making an ice cream cookie sandwich with mint chocolate chip ice cream.
